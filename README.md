Components Needed:
Arduino Board: Acts as the control unit.
8085 Microprocessor: Interfaces with the Arduino for processing and control.
Ultrasonic or Infrared Sensor: Detects hand proximity.
Dispenser Mechanism: Controls the release of sanitizer.
Power Supply: Provides power to the system.
Design and Implementation:
Hardware Setup:
Connect Sensor to Arduino: Wire the ultrasonic or infrared sensor to the Arduino to detect hand movement or proximity.
Interface 8085 with Arduino: Establish communication between the Arduino and 8085 microprocessor to trigger actions based on sensor inputs.
Integrate Dispenser Mechanism: Use a motor or solenoid controlled by the 8085 and triggered by the Arduino to dispense sanitizer.
Software/Programming:
Arduino Code: Write code on the Arduino to handle sensor readings and trigger the dispenser mechanism.

Use sensor input to detect hand proximity.
Upon detecting motion, send signals to the 8085 microprocessor.
8085 Assembly Language Code: Program the 8085 to respond to signals from the Arduino.

Upon receiving signals from the Arduino, activate the dispenser mechanism to release sanitizer.
Operational Flow:
Sensor Activation: When a hand is detected in proximity, the sensor sends a signal to the Arduino.
Arduino Processing: The Arduino processes the sensor signal and communicates with the 8085 microprocessor.
8085 Response: The 8085, upon receiving the signal, triggers the dispenser mechanism to release sanitizer.
Sanitizer Dispensing: The dispenser mechanism releases an appropriate amount of sanitizer for hands.
Considerations:
Safety: Ensure the system is safe to use and doesn't dispense sanitizer excessively.
Power Supply: Provide stable power to all components.
Testing and Calibration: Test the system thoroughly, calibrating sensor sensitivity and dispenser volume.
